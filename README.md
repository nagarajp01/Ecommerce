# My first Project
# Ecommerce
This is my first project, created using HTML and CSS.  
It’s a simple ecommerce website developed as part of my learning journey.  
Since I’m still exploring web development, this project focuses mainly on structure and design.
> *Note:* This project is primarily designed for desktop/laptop view.  
> Basic mobile responsiveness has been added only for the starting interface.  
> Mobile responsiveness is not implemented for the linked pages opened via anchor tags (e.g., clicking the OnePlus phone image redirects to pages without mobile-friendly design).
